# Cross-Doc

Cross-Doc is a JavaScript library designed to run under Node.js which helps
compile a collection of markdown files into HTML and PDF documents while
adding indexes and doing some management of cross-references.

## Installation

Use NPM to install cross-doc. If you are an end user you will probably want to
install cross-doc-cli instead.

You'll need to install from Github until the project reaches a state where I'm
ready to put it into NPM.

## Usage

I haven't written usage instructions yet, and don't have a sample project
available to the public. Good luck.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, you may wish to open an issue
first to discuss what you would like to change as rejection after doing the
work may hurt.
